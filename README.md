## Disclaimer

This project was made while I was taking The Complete JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy. I rebuilt the project in order to practice, but the general idea does not belong to me.

## How it works

- There are a few fictional accounts with some data that you can use in order to test the application, they are all listed in a modal window in the app.
- You can normally make the operations and see the changes afterwards. They will not be saved once you reload the browser, but you can still log out and then log into another account to see the money you've transfered to them for example.
